    "name": "Prism",
    "description": "A triangular glass object that separates white light into its constituent colors by bending each wavelength at a different angle.",
    "fact": "A prism demonstrates dispersion, the property that different colors of light travel at slightly different speeds through a medium, causing the familiar rainbow effect when white light passes through."

  {
    "name": "Birefringent Crystal",
    "description": "A type of crystal, like calcite, that splits incoming light into two beams traveling at different speeds and angles.",
    "fact": "Birefringent crystals reveal the fascinating property of double refraction, where a single ray of light is split into two rays, creating a doubled image when viewed through the crystal."

  {
    "name": "Quantum Dot",
    "description": "A nanoscale semiconductor that can absorb photons and re-emit them at specific wavelengths, depending on its size.",
    "fact": "Quantum dots change color based on their size due to the quantum property of photon absorption and emission, making them useful in ultra-precise imaging, television displays, and solar cells."

  {
    "name": "Blackbody",
    "description": "An idealized object that absorbs all incident light and emits radiation based on its temperature.",
    "fact": "A blackbody shows the property of thermal radiation, emitting light across the spectrum, from infrared to visible, which is why objects like stars glow in different colors depending on their temperature."
  },
  {
    "name": "Optical Fiber",
    "description": "A thin, flexible strand of glass or plastic that transmits light over long distances by bouncing light within its core.",
    "fact": "Optical fibers rely on total internal reflection, a process that allows light to travel through the fiber without escaping, enabling high-speed internet communication across oceans and continents."
