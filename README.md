## What is Litepage?

Litepage is a lightweight library to build your static sites, written in Go. Designed to simplify the web, Litepage allows you to build simple static sites without any unnecessary features, churn or bloat. In opposite fashion to the current frontend ecosystem, it strives for _simplicity over convenience_ with a small API surface and zero dependencies.

**Features:**

- Builds your static site ready to be hosted on GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.
- Serves your static site locally during development
- No plugins or extra packages to install
- Common recipes to help with Markdown, Tailwind CSS, live reloading and more
- Stable API with minimal changes over time

## Installation

```
go get github.com/man-on-box/litepage
```

## Project structure

The only folders Litepage interacts with by default are:

- `public/*` - to place your static assets (js, css, icons, images, etc.)
- `dist/*` - contains the outputted site when built, ready to be hosted

## Example

See an example project in [./example/main.go](./example/main.go)

**As simple as it gets:**

```go
func main() {
	lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

	lp.Page("/index.html", func(w io.Writer) {
		t := template.Must(template.New("helloWorld").Parse("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"))
		t.Execute(w, nil)
	})

	lp.BuildOrServe()
}
```

When built, `index.html` will be created in your `dist` folder containing your parsed template, along with any static assets contained within your `public` folder.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/man-on-box/litepage
```

## Usage

### Initialization

Create a new Litepage instance:

```go
lp, err := litepage.New("hello-world.com")
```

Optionally you can pass configuration options when creating the instance:

```go
lp, err = litepage.New("hello-world.com",
    litepage.WithDistDir("custom_dist"),
    litepage.WithPublicDir("custom_public"),
    litepage.WithoutSitemap(),
)
```

#### Options

- `WithDistDir` - Specify a custom dist directory to be used, that is created/written to when building the static site. Default value is `dist`.
- `WithPublicDir` - Specify a custom public directory to be used, that is read to retrieve static assets when building or serving the static site. Default value is `public`.
- `WithoutSitemap` - Do not create a sitemap of your site. By default a `sitemap.xml` is created mapping all pages of the static site. Disable this if you do not want this, or if you want to create your own sitemap.

### Creating pages

Create a new page by passing in the relative filename that will be used when building the site, such as `/index.html` or nested pages like '/articles/new-recipes.html'. **Note:** Paths must start with a `/`, include a file extension and be a valid filepath.

Here you also pass a second function that receives the standard `io.Writer` interface. All you need to do is write your templates to this interface to generate your pages with content. This means you can use any html templating library that supports this interface, such as the Go standard [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) package or custom packages like [templ](https://templ.guide/).

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

err := lp.Page("/index.html", func (w io.Writer) {
	    t := template.Must(template.New("helloWorld").Parse("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"))
	    t.Execute(w, nil)
})
```

An error is returned if the file path is not valid, or if you have already created a page with the same file path previously.

### Building your site

Once you have created all your pages, you can build your site. The outputted contents will be placed in the `/dist` directory, including all your assets in the `/public` directory.

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

// ... add all your pages

err := lp.Build()
```

The result in `/dist` directory can then be used with your preferred static site hosting service like GitHub Pages or CloudFlare pages. It should be an easy process to automate your project and automatically host the outputted files during CI.

### Serving your site

Building your site is the main goal, but what about when developing? Ideally instead of writing files to `/dist`, you could see your site hosted locally. For this you can call `Serve` to serve your site on your local machine.

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

// ... add all your pages

err := lp.Serve("3000")
```

This will start a dev server at http://localhost:3000 to preview your site.

### Build or Serve

Both methods explicitly build or serve your site, however if you want to be able to serve your site locally, while building it during CI, you can take advantage of the `BuildOrServe` method.

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

// ... add all your pages

err := lp.BuildOrServe()
```

By default, this will build your site the same as if you had called `Build`, however you can optionally `Serve` your site with the use of environment variables.

The following environment variables are checked when calling this method:

- `LP_MODE` - set this to `serve` to serve your site
- `LP_PORT` - set this to customise the port to serve your site on (default '3000')

See the [example Makefile](./example/Makefile) on how you could build or serve by specifying environment variables when building your application.
