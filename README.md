## What is Litepage?

Litepage is a tiny library to help you build static sites in Go. Build your HTML templates in Go and Litepage can build your pages for production and serve them locally during development, while adding only one dependency into your project.

**Features:**

- üéÅ Builds your static site ready to be hosted on any static site platform like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), etc.
- ‚ö° Serves your static site locally during development
- üßπ Maintains zero additional dependencies
- üìç Includes out of the box `sitemap.xml`
- üìñ Common recipes to help with Markdown, Tailwind CSS, live reloading and more
- üê¢ Stable API with no specific package knowledge required

## Motivation

If your site is serving static content with little client side interaction, you **don't need** a server and **you don't** need a framework. In todays world of JS frameworks, the reality is that most of your time is spent on **maintenance, not development**.

Frameworks promise performance, but the best way to build performant sites is to not ship bloat. A site does not inherently run faster on a users machine because you used a certain framework, but it _can run slower_.

The best way to give your users peformance, is to **ship the bare minimum HTML, CSS and JS required**.

Litepage is more of a philosophy than a library. It is an approach to build your sites in native Go, leveraging its standard library. Litepage can then build your site for production, and serve it whilst you are developing. This gives you full control on how you build your site, and a stable project that will live longer than the average frontend framework.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/man-on-box/litepage
```

## Project structure

The only folders Litepage interacts with by default are:

- `public/*` - to place your static assets (js, css, icons, images, etc.)
- `dist/*` - contains the outputted site when built, ready to be hosted

## Example

See an example project in [./example/main.go](./example/main.go)

**As simple as it gets:**

```go
func main() {
	lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

	lp.Page("/index.html", func(w io.Writer) {
		t := template.Must(template.New("helloWorld").Parse("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"))
		t.Execute(w, nil)
	})

	lp.Build()
}
```

When built, `index.html` will be created in your `/dist` folder containing your parsed template, along with any static assets contained within your `/public` folder.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/man-on-box/litepage
```

## Usage

### Initialization

Create a new Litepage instance:

```go
lp, err := litepage.New("hello-world.com")
```

Optionally you can pass configuration options when creating the instance:

```go
lp, err := litepage.New("hello-world.com",
    litepage.WithDistDir("custom_dist"),
    litepage.WithBasePath("/custom-base"),
    litepage.WithPublicDir("custom_public"),
    litepage.WithoutSitemap(),
)
```

#### Options

- `WithDistDir` - Specify a custom dist directory to be used, that is created/written to when building the static site. Default value is `dist`.
- `WithBasePath` - Specify the base path of your site, if it is not the root of the domain (for example, if deploying to GitHub Pages). If set, all static assets and links should add the base as a prefix. The path should always start with a `/` and not end with a trailing slash (otherwise an error will be returned).
- `WithPublicDir` - Specify a custom public directory to be used, that is read to retrieve static assets when building or serving the static site. Default value is `public`.
- `WithoutSitemap` - Do not create a sitemap of your site. By default a `sitemap.xml` is created mapping all pages of the static site. Disable this if you do not want this, or if you want to create your own sitemap.

### Creating pages

Create a new page by passing in the relative filename that will be used when building the site, such as `/index.html` or nested pages like `/articles/new-recipes.html`. **Note:** Paths must start with a `/`, include a file extension and be a valid filepath.

Here you also pass a function that receives the standard `io.Writer` interface. Write your templates to this interface to generate your pages with content. This means you can use any html templating library that supports this interface, such as the Go standard [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) package or custom packages like [templ](https://templ.guide/).

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

err := lp.Page("/index.html", func (w io.Writer) {
	    t := template.Must(template.New("helloWorld").Parse("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"))
	    t.Execute(w, nil)
})
```

An error is returned if the file path is not valid, or if you have already created a page with the same file path previously.

### Building your site

Once you have created all your pages, you can build your site. The outputted contents will be placed in the `/dist` directory, including all your assets in the `/public` directory.

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

// ... add all your pages

err := lp.Build()
```

The result in `/dist` directory can then be used with your preferred static site hosting service like GitHub Pages or CloudFlare pages. It should be an easy process to automate your build and host the outputted files during continuous integration.

### Previewing your site

So we know how to build, but what about when developing your site? Ideally instead of writing files to `/dist`, you could see your site hosted locally on your machine for a better developer experience. For this you can call `Serve` which serves your static site locally, instead of outputting it to your dist folder.

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

// ... add all your pages

err := lp.Serve("3000")
```

This will start a web server at http://localhost:3000 to preview your site.

### Build or Serve

The above methods explicitly build or serve your site, however if you want to be able to serve your site locally, while building it during CI, you can take advantage of the `BuildOrServe` method.

```go
lp, _ := litepage.New("hello-world.com")

// ... add all your pages

err := lp.BuildOrServe()
```

By default, this will build your site the same as if you had called `Build`, though you can optionally `Serve` your site with the use of environment variables.

The following environment variables are checked when calling this method:

- `LP_MODE` - set this to `serve` to serve your site
- `LP_PORT` - set this to customise the port to serve your site on (default '3000')

See the [example Makefile](./example/Makefile) on how you could build or serve by specifying environment variables when building your application.
